## Description
<p>The Envato Plugin Check is a fork of the Envato Theme Check plugin which is a modified version of Otto42's Theme Check with additional CodeCanyon specific checks.</p>
<p>It is an easy way to test your plugin and make sure it's up-to-date with the latest Envato review standards. With it, you can run all the same automated testing tools on your plugin that Envato Reviewers use for plugin submissions.</p>

<p>The tests are run through a simple admin menu and all results are displayed at once. This is very handy for plugin developers, or anybody looking to make sure that their plugin supports the latest WordPress plugin standards and practices.</p>
